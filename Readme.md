## PART 10 – Screenshots checklist (for submission)

Take these **at minimum**:

1. **Compilation Success** – `MyToken.sol` compiled with no errors.
2. **Deployment** – `MyToken` deployed under “Deployed Contracts” with an address.
3. **Token Info** – calls to `name`, `symbol`, `decimals`, `totalSupply`.
4. **Transfer Test** – transaction details + `Transfer` event or updated balances.
5. **Approve + transferFrom** – transaction logs showing `Approval` and `Transfer`.

## PART 11 – (Optional) Put in Git / GitHub

If your platform likes Git submissions:

1. Create a folder on your PC:
   - `MyToken/`
     - `MyToken.sol`
     - `README.md`
     - `/screenshots` (PNG/JPG images)
2. Initialize git in that folder.
3. Commit files and push to GitHub.
4. Submit the **GitHub repo link** + your screenshots as required.

If you want, next I can:
- Quickly **explain the code line by line** in super-simple words, or  
- Help you **modify the name/symbol/totalSupply** to your own custom token.
